# Project: Investigate a Dataset (No-Show Appointment)

 ## Introduction

  This dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. The dataset contains factors which may be important in predicting whether or not a patient will show up for an appointment. In this project, I will find which of the factors (age, gender, SMS remainder, diabetes, hypertension, alcoholism, handicap) can determine whether a patient shows up or not.


## Summary of Findings
  After analysing the dataset, these are my findings:

- Gender and alcoholism does not determine whether a patient will show up or not
- Patients without diabetes and hypertension are less likely to show up for appointments.
- Some patients who had scholarships or received SMS still didn't show up probably due to other factors.
- Compared to other age categories, Youth and Children are less likely toshow up for appointments.
- Patients with handicap levels 3 and 4 are less likely to show up for appointments. This may be because they cannot come on their own.
